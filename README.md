lzms
====

**lzms** is the lazy man's minesweeper game written in JavaScript (the name "lzms" 
itself is a lazy spelling of "lazy minesweeper"). Classic minesweeper is fun, but 
look at the board below, what's the point of manually flagging the leftmost column 
if it's so obvious that they're all mines?

```
_ 2 0
_ 3 0
_ 2 0
```

Life is short. **lzms** automatically does these trivial things for you. You 
play minesweeper in your mama's basement all day? Get a life and try **lzms** 
immediately.
