lzms
====

**lzms** is the lazy man's minesweeper game (the name "lzms" itself is a lazy 
spelling of "lazy minesweeper"). What's the point of manually flagging the 
leftmost column of the board below if it's so obvious that they're all mines?

Life is short. **lzms** automatically does these trivial things for you. May 
you live a more meaningful life.
